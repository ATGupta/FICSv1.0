# How to access the software?
The line 14 of main.py introduces a variable "st". The string stored in this variable is processed and water height is extracted.
This software can be attached to a larger system which fetches posts in real time. The file "main.py" can be called from such a system to generate water height at various geolocations and map a flood in real time.
The variable "height" defined at line 203 of the file process.py contains the height of water that has been extracted from the string which was passed through "st" introduced at line 14 of main.py.
